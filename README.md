This mod allows for the game console to be filtered out. This can help remove console spam, and make it easier to track down bugs.

## Isn't it a bad idea to remove information like this?

This greatly depends on the situation. This mod was specifically made with large modpacks in mind. For example, the typical FTB modpack may have over then thousand lines in the log about missing item models for WIP items and blocks. In a production pack like that nobody cares about that information, and it makes it harder for pack and mod devs to spot genuine issues.
